# coding challenges
A collection of algorithms I tried to understand via Interview Cake's problem-solving process.

# Prerequisites
* [Big O Notation](https://www.interviewcake.com/article/python/big-o-notation-time-and-space-complexity)
* [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/)
* An inquisitive mind!

# Please note
A lot of these are unsolved or random code snippets.
They do not account for all test cases, nor should they be taken as completed.

That said, **I will be adding newer coding challenges with much more comprehensive annotations** (comments in the code) as these will be referenced by my future self.

# Protips
I highly recommend stepping through these problems with a whiteboard and writing things out line by line!ðŸš€
